# Census Income Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting whether an individual's income exceeds $50,000 per year based on census data. Using machine learning techniques, we aim to classify individuals into two income categories: above or below $50K/year.

## Dataset
The "Census Income" dataset, also known as the "Adult" dataset, from UCI is utilized for this task [link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult)

## Model
Implemented Logistic regression and XGboost to classify individuals based on their predicted income level. The effectiveness of each model is evaluated based on its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Result 
Achieved an average accuracy of 86.01% using five-fold cross-validation with the XGBoost model
